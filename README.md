## Hi there
My name is Hamid Syed, I am a grade 11 student who is passionate for computer programming.

I had started programming when I was 10 years old, starting by learning p5.js on Khan Academy. Since then I have learned many other languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, C#, and GDscript, my least favorite being French. In the future, I hope to be a computer engineer and more into the hardware side as well, but as of now, I am (trying to be) an indie game developer.
Currently, one project that I have been trying to do was creating a multiplayer game (essentialy a MOBA) using node.js and socket.io as my backend. One challange that I face is being able to host it online so that I can release it to the public.
