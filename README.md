## Hi there
My name is Hamid Syed, I am a grade 12 student who is passionate for computer programming.

I had started programming when I was 10 years old, starting by learning p5.js on Khan Academy. Since then I have learned many other languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, C#, and GDscript.
Currently, one project that I have been trying to do was creating a multiplayer game using node.js and socket.io as my backend.
